SoundClone is my training version of SoundCloud, built to sharpen my frontend skills while integrating with a Django backend. The project includes all the core features of a music streaming platform:
•	🔊 Real-time music playback
•	⚡ PJAX-style page transitions (no reload)
•	❤️ Likes and following system
•	⬆️ Music upload support

Tech stack used:
•	Backend: Django
•	Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS

This project helped me dive deeper into media handling, dynamic UX, and user interaction — while also being a fun playground to experiment with UI and features.
